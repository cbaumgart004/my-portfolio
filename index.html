                Chris has been working in the industry for people with Intellectual and 
                Developmental Disabilities (I/DD) since 2005.  
                For nearly 20 years now, Chris has been working to develop tools, 
                skills, and programs to promote Independence and Agency for the 
                (I/DD) community.  Moving into Assistive Technology in 2011, he 
                quickly became one of the most adept programmers working with 
                Communication Devices, specializing in DynaVoxes.  
                As a proof of concept for the DPL (DynaVox Programming Language) 
                for their Series 5 devices, he created his own pirate-themed 
                hangman game in 2013 as a tool for individuals with various 
                degrees of mobility to learn targeted vocabulary in a cooperative 
                environment.  You can see a video of it in 
                action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqusW7EaOxY" alt="You Tube Welcome to the Pirates Cove">here</a>.  
                In recent years, after moving into a position of Technical and Customer Support for 
                CaraSolva, a company that provides an electronic means for companies 
                to record Medication Administration, Chris has begun learning frameworks 
                that will allow him to develop more tools that are more universally accessible.
